# About the Workshops

The oneAPI workshops are designed to help scientists and programmers use the oneAPI ecosystem to help optimize
and tune their CPU codes, and optionally to accelerate their codes on to GPUs using a combination of standardized
compilers, profilers and libraries.

## Workshop Format

Each workshop is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1** â€“ Presentations and demos.

- **Part 2** - Hands-on lab exercises.

## Why should you use oneAPI?

oneAPI is an open, cross-industry, standards-based programming model that unifies development across various
accelerator architectures. Here are some reasons why you might consider using oneAPI:

- **Freedom of Choice**: oneAPI allows you to target diverse hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and other
accelerators, not just from Intel but also from NVIDIA, AMD, ARM, and other vendors.

- **Open Alternative**: It provides an open alternative to proprietary lock-in, freeing you from being tied to a single
vendor's architecture and toolchain.

- **SYCL Abstraction**: SYCL, a standards-based abstraction layer for programming heterogeneous and offload
processors using modern ISO C++, simplifies development across different architectures.

- **Optimized Libraries**: oneAPI offers optimized libraries for API-based programming, enhancing both developer
productivity and application performance.

- **Advanced Debug Tools**: You get access to advanced analysis and debug tools to streamline development.
CUDA Source Code Migration: If you're coming from CUDA, oneAPI facilitates migrating your source code to a
more open and flexible environment.

In summary, oneAPI provides a common developer experience, faster performance, increased productivity, and
greater innovation across various hardware platforms.
