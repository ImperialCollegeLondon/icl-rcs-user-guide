# Bring your own Code - Hacktoberfest 2024

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. The motivation of Hacktoberfest is to celebrate all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special. 

This year the central [Research Software Engineering team](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/service-offering/research-software-engineering/) at Imperial, is planning to host two in-person events during Hacktoberfest, on the 1st and the 23rd of October. The events will be open to anybody interested in participating in open source software, either coding or with non-code contributions. Everybody is welcome to join the events and bring their own code along for a discussion with the central RSE team members. We can (try to) offer advice about a variety of things related to software development best practices, including code design, tooling (including use of Git and GitHub), optimization or anything else you can think of.

Remember that Hacktoberfest also welcomes [low code and non-code contributions](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#low-or-non-code) - a big chunk of what surrounds good open source software has nothing to do with code!

## Dates

Both events will be the full day and include morning and afternoon coffee, as well as lunch. These are the details:
