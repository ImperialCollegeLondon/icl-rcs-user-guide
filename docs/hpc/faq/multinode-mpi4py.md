# How to run multinode Python jobs using Mpi4py

[Mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (read as MPI for Python) provides Python bindings for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, allowing Python applications to exploit multiple processors on workstations, clusters and supercomputers.

In the past, we noticed that some users were having issues running multinode Python jobs using Mpi4py. This page provides a brief guide on how to run such jobs on our HPC facility.
