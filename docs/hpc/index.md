# High Performance Computing


The [Research Computing Service (RCS)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/) at [Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) provides access to [several High Performance Computing (HPC) systems](./cluster-specification.md) that support research across the university. These systems are designed to handle a wide variety of computational workloads, including:

* Highly parallel processing
* High-throughput computing
* Data-intensive tasks
* GPU-accelerated workloads (including AI applications)

This documentation offers guidance on how to effectively use these HPC resources. 

## Registering for access

You must have a full Imperial account and be registered with the HPC service before you can use it. Please visit the [Get Access](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/get-access/) page on the main RCS web pages for information on how to register to use the HPC service. You will also need some experience with using the Linux Operating system and shell scripting before you use the HPC service; please see the [Using Linux](../support/using-linux/index.md) page for advice on where you can gain experience, including details on an appropriate course provided by the [Graduate School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/) at Imperial.

We recommend all users (regardless of your prior experience with HPC) the review the [Getting Started](./getting-started/index.md) page before trying to use the facility.
