# High Performance Computing

The Research Computing Service (RCS) at Imperial College provide access to a large High Performance Computing (HPC) facilityâ€¯for non-interactive, high-throughput and highly parallel compute- and data-intensive tasks. 

You must be registered with the HPC service in order to use it. Please visit the Research Computing Service home page for information on how to register to use the HPC service. You will also need some experience with using the Linux Operating system and shell scripting before you use the HPC service; please see Using Linux for advice on where you can gain experience, including details on an appropriate course provided by the Graduate School at Imperial College.

We recommend all users (regardless of your prior experience with HPC) the review the [Getting Started](./getting-started/index.md) page before trying to use the facility.
