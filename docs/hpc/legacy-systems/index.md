## What happened to...

### CX1

CX1 is the name for the old HPC service, consisting of many compute nodes with a range of specifications, connected over 1GbE.

Due to their age, with all of the compute nodes out of warranty by many years (and some in fact unsafe to leave running), all of the CX1 nodes were decommissioned in 2024.

### CX2

CX2 was the HPC cluster with a fast interconnect (Infiniband) designed for large-scale multi-node jobs. Most of the hardware was very old and a large proportion of it failed over Christmas 2022/2023. It was completely decommissioned in January 2023 to make way for the [HX1](../hx1.md) cluster which replaced it.
