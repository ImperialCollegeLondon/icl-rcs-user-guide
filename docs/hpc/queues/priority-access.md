# Priority Access

!!! info

    This page **has** been rewritten for CX3 Phase 2.

We are currently developing a new priority access service for CX3 (Phase 2). While this new service is in development, if you have an urgent/imminent deadline to meet (such as a conference submission or PhD submission) and you are unable to make this deadline with standard queuing times, please [get in contact](../../support/index.md) with us for assistance.

## Express access

Express access is only available on the [CX3 Legacy](../legacy-systems/cx3-legacy.md) facility; please see the [Express Access](../legacy-systems/cx3-legacy.md#express-access) section for more information. We are in the process of developing a replacement service for CX3 Phase 2 that will be more flexible, more reliable and easier to maintain.
