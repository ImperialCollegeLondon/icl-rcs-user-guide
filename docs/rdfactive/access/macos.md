# RDF-Active on macOS

The following instructions will show you how to connect your Mac to the RDF-Active so you can access the files. You must be connected to either the college network or otherwise following the advice on [accessing services remotely](../../remoteaccess.md) before you can connect to the RDS.

## Connecting your Mac to the RDS

* Select **Go** from the **Finder menu**
* Select **Connect to server...**
* Enter the **RDF-Active** path you wish to connect in the **Server Address** box:
    * For the "base" path of the RDF-Active  `smb://rdf-active.ic.ac.uk/research/`
    * Or read the [Where are my files](./index.md#where-are-my-files) section to map a specific storage allocation. 
* If you haven't already logged in with your Imperial **username** and **password**, enter them now to connect
