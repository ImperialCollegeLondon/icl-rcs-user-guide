# RDF-Active

RDF-Active is part of the new Research Data Facility suite, designed to replace RDS Project storage with a more flexible model that aligns with how research groups work. Storage is now organised around research teams rather than individual projects, and access is managed through the new [Research Computing Access Portal](../recap/index.md).

We’re now in the final stages of launching RDF-Active into production. As part of this process, we’ve started reaching out to RDS Project owners to support the migration of their data to RDF-Active.

Additional guidance on how to use the new service and request that data be migrated from RDS will be published over the coming weeks.
