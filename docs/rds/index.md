# Research Data Store

The Research Data Store is provided by the RCS for storing large volume of research data. You **don't** have to be registered in the HPC to use this service. Please visit the [Research Computing Service Getting Access](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/get-access/) for information on how to register for the RDS.

## Managing your Research Data

It is important to manage the data you store on the RDS to ensure that you comply with the University's and your funders Research Data Management policy, and also to reduce the frustration of locating data as your data volumes grow. The following links will introduce you to research data management, best practices and policies held by the College and many of the main grant funders.
