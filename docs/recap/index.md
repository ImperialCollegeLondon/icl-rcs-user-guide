# Research Computing Access Portal (RECAP)

**RECAP** (Research Computing Access Portal) is a new self-service platform designed to help you manage access to research computing services provided by the [RCS](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/), including systems such as [RDF-Active](../rdfactive/index.md) and HX2.

Further guidance on how to access and use the portal will be shared soon.
