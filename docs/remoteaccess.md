# Accessing Services Remote

You must have access to the Imperial College network in order to access RCS facilities such as the HPC service and the Research Data Store. We recommend you following the advice provided at [Accessing services when off campus](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/connect-communicate/remote-access/) on how to access applications on campus that require a private secure network.

ICT recommends that you use [Unified Access](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/connect-communicate/remote-access/unified-access/) to access College applications (such as HPC and the RDS services), which can be done from anywhere in the world, directly from your device. This replaces the need to use a VPN or remotely accessing a computer. The following advice is retained for those users who have not migrated to Unified Access yet.

## OpenVPN

For those who have retained access to the OpenVPN service, you should still be able to access all RCS services when using OpenVPN on Windows or Linux. However, an increasing number of RCS services are only accessible over ipv6 and OpenVPN on macOS will not enable you to connect to ipv6 services on the University network unless you have an existing ipv6 address before connecting.
