## Getting Help

We provide support to users via the ICT service desk, please see our [Get Support page](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/get-support/contact-us/) for advice on how to raise a ticket with us.

HPC clinics are a good way to discuss your issue directly with an RCS team member. Please see the [Attend a clinic](./attend-a-clinic.md) page for more information.
